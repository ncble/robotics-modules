# robotics-modules

(project ongoing...)

This project is a modular toolbox designed for robotics research including three modules: (1) Simulated environment. About ~20 times faster compared to gym, pybullet for 2D environments. e.g. 3,000+ frame-per-second FPS on 1 thread of Intel CPU i9-9900K. (2) Pytorch reinforcement algorithms (3) State-representation learning that improves sample-efficiency of RL agent (both end-to-end or decoupled).
